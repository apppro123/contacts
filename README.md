## Shoutout
I want to thank [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for the great platform and the other plugin (creators) where I got some inspiration especially in the early stages of obsidian plugin developement. 

Especially thanks to the creators/maintainers of the [Text Expander Plugin](https://github.com/akaalias/text-expander-plugin) where I got the idea/code for the string trigger/replacement :)

## (still) ToDo
- implement testing
- CSV (file) for easy export/import to/from other applications

### settings
- open modal with key shortcut

### data structure for storing/presenting in obsidian
- one file per contact
- at the top should be a #contact
- other fields should start with a #[name of this field] [content of this field]
  - e.g. #firstname George
