## Shoutout
I want to thank obsidian for the great platform and the other plugin (creators) where I got some inspiration especially in the early stages of obsidian plugin developement. 

Especially thanks to the creators/maintainers of the ["Text Expander Plugin"](https://github.com/akaalias/text-expander-plugin) where I got the idea/code for the string trigger/replacement :)
